================================================================================
PAGES 6-10 ERRORS (ALL FIXED ✅)
================================================================================

✅ Error 11: DUPLICATE HARDWARE DESCRIPTION - FIXED
   (Merged into single paragraph in Section 7)

✅ Error 12: Missing thrust-to-weight ratio value - FIXED
   (Now shows "approximately 3.6:1")

================================================================================
PAGES 11-15 ERRORS (MOSTLY FIXED)
================================================================================

✅ Error 13: Newton-Euler equation notation - FIXED
   (Now shows τ = I(dω/dt))

✅ Error 14: WRONG FIGURE REFERENCE - FIXED
   (Now correctly says "Figure 12 illustrates...")

⬜ Error 15: DUPLICATE/WRONG GRAPH - Figure 13
   ❌ STILL WRONG! Caption says "Angle mode" but GRAPH IMAGE still shows "Rate Mode"
   Graph title needs to change to "Angle Mode" OR replace the graph image entirely

⬜ Error 15b: Figure 8 & Figure 12 Caption Formatting - NEEDS FIX
   Current format mixes diagram name with signals in one paragraph.
   Need to separate: Name on first line, Signals listed below.

   CURRENT (Figure 12):
   "Angle Mode Cascade Control with Complementary Filter. Signals: θref = angle setpoint
   (deg), eθ = angle error, ωsp = rate setpoint, eω = rate error, u = control output, ω = 
   angular rate, θ̂ = estimated angle from complementary filter"

   FIX - Format like this:
   "Figure 12: Angle Mode Cascade Control with Complementary Filter.
   
   Signals:
   θref = angle setpoint (deg)
   eθ = angle error  
   ωsp = rate setpoint
   eω = rate error
   u = control output
   ω = angular rate
   θ̂ = estimated angle from complementary filter"

   Apply same formatting fix to Figure 8 (Rate Mode Control Loop Block Diagram):

   CURRENT (Figure 8):
   "Rate Mode Control Loop Block Diagram. Signals: ωref = rate setpoint (deg/s), e = error,
   u=control output, ω = measured angular rate, Gc(s) = PID controller, Gp(s) = plant."

   FIX - Format like this:
   "Figure 8: Rate Mode Control Loop Block Diagram.
   
   Signals:
   ωref = rate setpoint (deg/s)
   e = error
   u = control output
   ω = measured angular rate
   Gc(s) = PID controller
   Gp(s) = plant"

================================================================================
PAGES 16-20 ERRORS (MOSTLY FIXED)
================================================================================

✅ Error 16: Value discrepancy Table 10 vs Figure 15 - FIXED
   (Both now show 424 ms rise time, 647 ms settling time)

✅ Error 17: Grammar "Propose Project" - FIXED
   (Now says "the proposed project avoids")

⬜ Error 18: Section numbering (C.1, C.2) - NOT FIXED
   ❌ Still shows "3.1 Mapping" and "3.2 Data Formatting"
   Fix: Change to "C.1 Mapping" and "C.2 Data Formatting"

================================================================================
PAGES 21-24 ERRORS (MOSTLY FIXED)
================================================================================

✅ Error 19: Wrong Figure Reference - FIXED
   (Text removed/rephrased, no wrong Figure 8 reference)

⚠️ Error 20: DUPLICATE Conclusion Paragraph - PARTIAL FIX
   Still has duplicate text "These results can help in providing..."
   Appears at end of GCS section AND in Results section

✅ Error 21: Grammar "can connects" - FIXED
   (Now says "can connect theory")

================================================================================
NEW ADDITIONS (VERIFIED ✅)
================================================================================

✅ Figure 18: GCS Circuit schematic - ADDED
✅ Figure 19: Web application front end - PRESENT
✅ Figure 20: Prototype setup - PRESENT

⚠️ ESP8266 WiFi Justification - NOT FOUND
   The circuit explanation is present, but the justification paragraph
   (about future WiFi compatibility) is not visible in the paper.

================================================================================
NEW ADDITIONS REQUIRED
================================================================================

⬜ ESP8266 Justification (Ground Station section)
Add text explaining why ESP8266 was chosen:
"The ESP8266 microcontroller was selected for the ground station receiver to maintain 
architectural consistency with the ESP32-based flight controller. Since the ESP32 features 
integrated Wi-Fi, future implementations can optionally bypass the nRF24L01 radio link 
and establish direct Wi-Fi communication between the drone and ground station. Although 
Wi-Fi significantly decreases the operational range, this forward-compatible design allows 
students or researchers to experiment with Wi-Fi telemetry by simply updating firmware 
on both ends, without hardware modifications."

⬜ GCS Circuit Schematic (NEW FIGURE)
Add circuit explanation:
"Figure [X] shows the circuit schematic of the ground control station receiver unit. The 
design consists of an ESP8266 microcontroller interfaced with an nRF24L01 2.4GHz radio 
module via SPI communication. The nRF24L01 is connected using standard SPI pins: MOSI, 
MISO, SCK (clock), and CSN (chip select). The CE (Chip Enable) pin controls the radio's 
transmit/receive mode. The nRF24L01 adapter module is powered through the ESP8266's VIN 
pin, which outputs 5V when the ESP8266 is USB-powered; the adapter's onboard regulator 
then provides 3.3V to the radio module."

================================================================================
GCS SECTION FLOW
================================================================================

1. First explain WHY ESP8266 was chosen (justification)
2. Then show GCS CIRCUIT schematic (new figure)
3. Then show GCS BLOCK DIAGRAM (Figure 17)
4. Then Web Application screenshot (Figure 18)

================================================================================
RESULTS SECTION - GRAPH PLACEMENT NOTE
================================================================================

📝 NOTE: Experimental graphs (Figures 4-7: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Kalman, Complementary)
   are placed in METHODOLOGY (Section 8. Experimental graphs), NOT in Results section.
   
   This is ACCEPTABLE - they justify sensor fusion choice in methodology.
   
   Results section currently only has Figure 20 (Prototype setup photo).
   
   OPTIONAL: Add reference text in Results to link back to methodology graphs:
   "Sensor fusion performance is validated in Section III.B (Figures 4-7)."

================================================================================
RESULTS SECTION IMPROVEMENT (OPTIONAL)
================================================================================

Add improved Results text referencing existing figures:

"Experimental validation of the developed UAV was carried out through hover tests and 
controlled flight experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed hardware 
configuration and control methodology provide stable flight performance.

Control System Performance: The rate mode controller achieved a damping ratio of ζ = 0.71 
with zero overshoot and 79 ms rise time (Figure 10). The angle mode controller demonstrated 
overdamped response with ζ = 0.96, zero steady-state error, and effective drift compensation 
(Figure 15). Both controllers exceed standard stability requirements with phase margins of 
81° (Figures 11 and 16).

Sensor Fusion: The complementary filter successfully mitigated gyroscope drift and 
accelerometer noise, maintaining attitude estimation accuracy within ±0.5° (Figures 4-7)."
